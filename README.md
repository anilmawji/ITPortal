## ‚ú® Features

- Interact with your scripts using a modern, intuitive UI, allowing for easy parameter entry and editing.

- Authenticate with Microsoft Entra ID to securely request and feed access tokens to scripts from Azure Key Vault.

- Save and load script jobs via a portable JSON format, allowing easy transfer between different environments.

- Store and compare previous execution results to track performance and troubleshoot with ease.

- View automatically categorized script outputs that isolate standard output, warnings, and errors for easier debugging and analysis.

- Enjoy a hassle-free experience as saved script jobs are automatically loaded from disk on startup

## üñ•Ô∏è Supported Platforms

- Currently, only Windows is officially supported.
- macOS support will be added in a future update.

## üìå Roadmap

- Ability to schedule the execution of script jobs so they can run at a specified date & time.
- I am currently in the middle of abstracting the script execution pipeline from the PowerShell runtine environment. This will allow other types of scripts (Python, Bash) to eventually be supported as well.
- Mac Catalyst integration for macOS users.

## üîó Dependencies

This project runs on .NET 8.0. Make sure to install it [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0)  before attempting to build.

## üõ† Building and Running

This project is still in active development, but feel free to download and play around with it yourself!

I recommend using [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) or greater to build and deploy, though you might be able to use VSCode instead.

1. Clone the git repo

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/anilmawji/PowerShell-Script-Profiler.git
   ```

2. Enter project directory

   ```sh
   cd "PowerShell-Script-Profiler\ScriptProfiler"
   ```

3. Build application

   ```sh
   dotnet build
   ```

4. Run (Windows only)

   ```sh
   dotnet run --framework net8.0-windows10.0.19041.0
   ```

## üöÄ Deploying

Ship the app as an executable so it can run independently of your IDE and the .NET SDK (Windows only)

   ```sh
   dotnet publish -f net8.0-windows10.0.19041.0 -c Release -p:RuntimeIdentifierOverride=win10-x64 -p:WindowsPackageType=None -p:WindowsAppSDKSelfContained=true
   ```

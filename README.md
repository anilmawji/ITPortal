## ðŸ”— Dependencies

This project runs on .NET 8.0. Make sure to install it [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0)  before attempting to build.

I recommend using [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) to build and deploy the app, though you might be able to get away with VSCode instead.

## ðŸ›  Building and Running

This project is still in active development, but feel free to download and play around with it yourself!

As of now, Windows is the only officially supported platform. macOS is currently unsupported, though support will arrive in a future update.

1. Clone the git repo

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/anilmawji/PowerShell-Script-Profiler.git
   ```

2. Enter project directory

   ```sh
   cd "PowerShell-Script-Profiler\ScriptProfiler"
   ```

3. Build application

   ```sh
   dotnet build
   ```

4. Run (Windows only)

   ```sh
   dotnet run --framework net8.0-windows10.0.19041.0
   ```

## ðŸš€ Deploying

Ship the app so it can run independently of your IDE and the .NET SDK (Windows only)

   ```sh
   dotnet publish -f net8.0-windows10.0.19041.0 -c Release -p:RuntimeIdentifierOverride=win10-x64 -p:WindowsPackageType=None -p:WindowsAppSDKSelfContained=true
   ```
